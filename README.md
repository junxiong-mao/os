# os

This is a kernel implementation based on X86 architecture. I followed the tutorial on http://wiki.0xffffff.org/

To run the kernel, you need to have qemu installed in your linux machine, and then execute following commands:

1. make
2. make qemu

The kernel will be executed inside the virtual machine.

The project is still under development.
